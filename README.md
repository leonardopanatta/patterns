patterns
========

Simple implementations to ilustrate design patterns and how they can help us to build better code and how anti-patterns can destroy it.

Implemented so far:

### Design Patterns

> GoF Creational
  
* [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/leonardopanatta/patterns/tree/master/patterns/src/net/panatta/patterns/designpattern/gof/creational/abstractfactory)

  Consists of a source of command objects and a series of processing objects. Each processing object contains logic that defines the types of command objects that it can handle; the rest are passed to the next processing object in the chain. A mechanism also exists for adding new processing objects to the end of this chain.

> GoF Behavioral
  
* [Chain of Responsibility](https://github.com/leonardopanatta/patterns/tree/master/patterns/src/net/panatta/patterns/designpattern/gof/behavioral/chainofresponsibility)

  Consists of a source of command objects and a series of processing objects. Each processing object contains logic that defines the types of command objects that it can handle; the rest are passed to the next processing object in the chain.
